Components of the design:-


a) The topmost design source file is System. (System.vhd)
b) Main 3 components of System:
1. Slow Clock (Slow_Clk.vhd) :- count is set to 3000000 to slow down 
2. Nano processor (nano_processor.vhd) :- contains all components in processor
3. ROM for 7 segment (LUT_16_7.vhd) :- Store 7 segment display outputs for each digit. 


Inputs to system :- Clk (for board clock)
                               Res ( reset button)


Outputs from system:- Zero (to represent all output 4 bits are zero)
                                    Overflow (indicate whether there is a overflow)
                         S_7Seg (Outputs for seven segment display)
                                    S_out (value of Register 7)
                                Anode ( Anode configuration - power only LSB in 7 seg display)


Test on Basys3 board


Mapping of pins/buttons of board


1. Reset button (Res) :- U18 
2. Clock (Clk) :- W5


Clock signal associates with W5 Pin. I/0 standard for the clock signal is LVCMOS33 with a period of 10 ns and 5 ns high and 5 ns low.


3. LEDs for 4 bits for R7 out (S_out) :- 


S_out(3) → V19     (MSB)
S_out(2) → U19
S_out(1) → E19
S_out(0) → U16     (LSB)


4. 7 segment display (S_7Seg) :- 


S_7Seg[0] → W7
S_7Seg[1] → W6
S_7Seg[2] → U8
S_7Seg[3] → V8
S_7Seg[4] → U5
S_7Seg[5] → V5
S_7Seg[6] → U7


5. Zero flag (Zero) :- P1
6. Overflow flag (Overflow) :- L1


7. Anode 


Anode[0] → U2
Anode[1] → U4
Anode[2] → V4
Anode[3] → W4 


7 Seg Display is in Common anode configuration. Make the anode High(1) for first 3 displays and keep Low(0) only the last 7 segment display which for Least Significant Bit


Functionality of Program :- 


Binary hard coded assembly program for finding sum of numbers from 1 to 3. 8  instructions.


Observation of Basys3 testing :- 


When bitstream is loaded to board :- 




Display 1 in seven seg. And output LEDs. (1)
Then Display 3 in seven seg Display and output LEDs (1+2=3)
Finally display 6 in seven seg. Display and output LEDs. (3+3=6)


When we press the reset button U 18 above, the process repeats.
